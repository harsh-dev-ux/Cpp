## 📌 Overview
This repository is not just a collection of code; it is a structured archive of my deep dive into **Modern C++**. 

Moving beyond basic syntax, this repo focuses on **how the computer actually works**—understanding stack vs. heap, memory management, pointers, and writing latency-critical code.

## 📂 What's Inside?

| Module | Description | Focus Area |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01-Basics** | Syntax, Control Flow, Type Systems | `Core Logic` |
| **02-Memory** | **Pointers, References**, Stack vs Heap, Smart Pointers | `Internals` |
| **03-OOP** | Classes, Polymorphism, Virtual Functions, Templates | `Architecture` |
| **04-STL** | Vectors, Maps, Sets, Priority Queues | `Data Structures` |
| **05-Projects** | Real-world applications and system simulations | `Application` |


## 🎯 The Goal (The "Why")

I am building this codebase to master C++ for:
*   **High-Performance Computing:** Understanding the language at a low level (Assembly/Memory).
*   **Competitive Programming:** preparing for ICPC and global hackathons.
*   **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Implementing custom data structures from scratch.
*   **Architecture:** Writing clean, modular, and maintainable object-oriented code.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
*   **Language:** C++ (Standard C++17 / C++20)
*   **Compiler:** g++ / MSVC
*   **IDE:** VS Code
*   **Learning Resource:** The Cherno, Striver, Documentation

## 📝 Progress Log

- [ ] **Phase 1:** Core Syntax & Pointers (The Cherno Series)
- [ ] **Phase 2:** Object-Oriented Programming
- [ ] **Phase 3:** Standard Template Library (STL) Deep Dive
- [ ] **Phase 4:** DSA Implementation
- [ ] **Phase 5:** **HFT/System Projects** (Order Matching Engine, etc.)
